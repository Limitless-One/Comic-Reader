I took on this project as a passion project to get accustomed to vibe coding. Initially unfamiliar with PyQT5, I took on the challenge of trying to create a Python based UI heavy application.

The comic reader application is meant for reading comics stored locally, in various file formats such as images, .pdf, .cbz, .epub, etc.
I have tried to include several crucial features such an application expects and optimizations to make the application efficient.
After the most recent refactoring, I have included the basic framework for several new features. These features have yet to be refined, so they may look crude and unpolished.

The application follows the MVC (Model View Controller) framework and is suitable for Mac or Windows.

To run the application, download the files, install the dependencies, and run main.py. I'll include a standalone, packaged app once I complete polishing it.

I'll provide a more detailed summary of features once I complete polishing the recently added features.
